Assignment: Project 2 - The Parser
Class: CS 4280
Teacher: Mark Hauschild


Project will be invoked as 'frontEnd'.

To run:

- Run 'make' 
- Three invocation methods (like in P0): 
	1. user input through the keyboard: ./frontEnd
	2. through pre-existing file (program adds extension .sp2022): ./frontEnd [file]
	3. through pre-existing file redirection (user adds extension): ./frontEnd < [file.ext]



FSA table adjustments/fixes made, should now work totally perfectly (located in scanner.cpp)
